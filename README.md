# GlossyHelper
Simple offline glossary app built with JavaScript

GlossyHelper

Glossy is a small offline app I’m building in JavaScript as part of my programming and English studies.
It’s meant to be a simple tool where I can add words, make small quizzes, and save my own glossary lists.

It’s not fancy or big — just something I’m creating to learn more about coding and build something useful at the same time.

 Features (so far)

Add words and definitions

Save them locally in the browser

See the full list anytime, even offline

 Planned ideas

A small quiz/test mode

Import and export of word lists

A cleaner layout

This is a learning project, so the code might change a lot while I experiment and improve.
